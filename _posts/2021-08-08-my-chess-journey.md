As you read in my previous blog, [picked up Chess(again!)](/chess-engines-databases-resources)

Blah blah, i'll update this with more details later.

I love solving tactics on lichess. Themed as well as the mixbag. 
But I'm gonna try to solve tactics from books now.

I've picked up Chess Training Pocket Book: 300 Most Important Positions and Ideas by Lev Alburt

Oh and I created a lichess study (interactive) based on this book! :grin:
