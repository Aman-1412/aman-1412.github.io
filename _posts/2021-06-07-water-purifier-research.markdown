## What?

I need to buy a new water purifier. Here's all the research I've done on the features/brands/products. As usual, dumping it in the blog for posterity.

If the output water from your purifier has very low TDS (less than 150) then it means your purifier is generating more waste water. A very low level of TDS not only results in higher wastage of water but it is also bad for our health as it is devoid of essential minerals. Increasing the TDS will not only make the drinking water healthier but also reduce the wastage. You can increase the TDS level of your water purifier using the TDS controller knob

Not going for those copper ones. Those higher immunity things come with some caveats and a price tag. No thanks.
Don't need hot and cold water facility either.

### The Chosen One(s)

My minimal requirement is RO + UV, per my understanding so far.

My preferred choices:

[HUL Pureit Eco Water Saver Mineral RO+UV+MF wall mounted/Counter top Black 10L Water Purifier](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08BJN4MP3)

[Eureka Forbes AquaSure from Aquaguard Delight (RO+UV+MTDS) 7L water purifier,6 stages of purification (White)](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07SQX4GHH)

[HUL Pureit Advanced Pro Mineral RO+UV 6 stage wall mounted counter top black 7L Water Purifier](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08B27R8MP)

#### Update

Finally went with a model that was locally available and well supported. ONLY eureka forbes has good customer service in my city(or so the salesman told me) :man_shrugging:

**My choice:** _Eureka Forbes AquaSure MAXIMA Plus(RO+UV+MTDS+ME)_ :star2:

**Water quality:**

Tap water: 500 ppm

Purified water: ~140 ppm (the installation guy was in a rush. Initially the water was around ~400 ppm and it kept falling. As soon as it reached 140 ppm, he just up and left, with a broken installation mount, broken LED and water leakage issues with the water purifier. Took me additional 2 weeks before Eureka Forbes sent someone to fix everything. SMH)

I can finally drink water happily :smiley:
